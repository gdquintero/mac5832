    "\n",
    "The output of $h$ is a linear transformation of $\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}$. We use the notation $h(\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}; \\mathbf{w}, b)$ to make clear that $h$ is a parametric model, i.e., the transformation $h$ is defined  by the parameters $\\mathbf{w}$ and $b$. We can view vector $\\mathbf{w}$ as a *weight* vector that controls the effect of each *feature* in the prediction.\n",
